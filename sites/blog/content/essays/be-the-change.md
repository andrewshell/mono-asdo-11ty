Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States.

There will be a lot of negativity in the coming days. A lot of finger pointing, name calling, blaming and possibly violence. Please don't participate in the negativity.

This is an opportunity to listen to each other. A large part of our country spoke last night. They are tired of being ignored, they are in pain. They want what all of us want. To be loved and to provide for themselves and their families.

They feel that Donald Trump is the best chance they have to change a system that they feel is hurting them. A system that is hurting their families and communities.

As a nation, we now have the opportunity to listen to each other. To understand each other and do the best we can to move forward and make this country great for all of us.

If you're like me and are scared about what this election means for our families and communities. If you're scared of what it means for people of color, for women, for LGBTQ people, for Muslims and Jews. Take comfort in all the good in the world.

I think that many Trump supporters are kind, caring, thoughtful people. They are not the racist, misogynistic monsters portrayed by the news.

Don't ask why is this happening to us. But what opportunities does this present for us all to be the change we want in the world?

Do not shut out your friends, family or neighbors who voted differently than you yesterday. Listen. Don't lecture or try to convince. Just listen. We are more common than different.
