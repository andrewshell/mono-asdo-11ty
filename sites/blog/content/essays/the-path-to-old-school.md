Dave has sent me some pointers to look at his blogging platform Old School. I'm excited to try it out.

I was able to get it working. I have it live at <a href="http://os.geekity.com/">os.geekity.com</a>

Next step is to customize it more. I found the template files although I haven't quite figured out why [%copyright%] isn't resolving. It doesn't appear to be something in the glossary which was my first guess.

I'll also need to track down where the countdown is coming from.
