My life needs fixing.  There are a lot of things going on that I need to repair.  Some of which are:

1. Lose weight, get in shape

2. Develop the power to avoid procrastination

3. Improve my concentration

4. Start my own business

I think the key to solving these problems is to put those parts of my life on autopilot.  If I can get into a routine where I don't have to think in order to succeed ideally I'll be more inclined to actually accomplish my goals.

A good example of this is what I've done already with working out.  I signed up for [Orange Shoe Personal Fitness](http://orangeshoe.com/) which has been great.  The reason it's worked better then a traditional gym membership is the accountability.  Since I'm working in small groups (no more then 4 people) or one-on-one personal training, when I schedule a session I know I have to go.  People will notice and contact me if I miss a session.  I got a routine of when I go and I've been going 2-3 times a week since I started.  And since I'm working with a personal trainer I don't have to think about what exercises I'm going to do or if I'm pushing myself too hard or not enough.  I just show up and they tell me what to do.  Obviously this is more expensive then a traditional gym membership, but I'm getting results.

What else will I be able to put on autopilot?  I'm thinking I should put together a morning checklist.  Something where every day I wake up and go through each item on the list.  That way I can make sure I do the things I need to do like my stretching exercises and 10-15 minutes of meditation.

What are some aspects of your life that could benefit from being on autopilot?
