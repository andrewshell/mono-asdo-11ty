I just arrived in Toronto yesterday for the third PHP Works conference I've attended. The last two years were incredible and I have no doubts that this year will be great as well. I will try to post several entries while I'm here detailing what talks I've attended and such. Today is the all day seminars.

Assuming that the schedule stays the same I think I'll attend "AJAX and PHP Boot Camp" in the morning and "Advanced XML and Web Services" in the afternoon. The session "Extending PHP" sounds interesting but I attended an extending PHP talk last year and it went over my head. I understood some of it but C isn't my strong point so if I get better at C then I can take a crack at extension writing.
