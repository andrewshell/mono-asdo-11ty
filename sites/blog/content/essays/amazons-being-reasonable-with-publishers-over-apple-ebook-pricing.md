I read an article today on Silicon Alley Insider [Amazon Tells Small Publishers It Will Stop Selling Their Books If They Join Apple](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tells-small-publishers-it-will-stop-selling-their-books-if-they-join-apple-2010-3) which if that was the case would clearly be big news.  However I read the quote and I'm left scratching my head.  It actually doesn't seem from what they print in the article that Amazon is actually threatening to de-list publishers to sell with Apple.  I figure I should do a little more research and follow the links back to the original article from Melville House Publishing [Hysterical Amazon exec calls 911, says accelerator is stuck and he can’t keep from running over publishers](http://mhpbooks.com/mobylives/?p=13605) and it further solidifies my initial impression.  Here's how I'm paraphrasing the conversation between Amazon and the Publisher:

**Publisher**: Hey Amazon, we're not happy with this "Wholesale Model" for selling ebooks on your website

**Amazon**: So? That's how we do it.

**Publisher**: But Apple is letting us sell with the "Agency Model" which we're much happier with, we want to sell through Amazon with the Agency Model too

**Amazon**: No, we're not interested in doing that

**Publisher**: But you're doing it with Hachette, Harper, Penguin and Simon & Schuster!

**Amazon**: Well, we're in negotiations with them, nothing is final yet

**Publisher**: We want to negotiate too

**Amazon**: No, as matter of policy we are declining to negotiate an agency model with any publisher outside of the five who have already announced agreements with Apple’s iBookstore

**Publisher**: But we want to negotiate

**Amazon**: Tough shit

**Publisher**: Well, us little guys are going to band together and FORCE you to do it our way

**Amazon**: Go right ahead, we're more then happy to remove you from our website, we're not negotiating

**Publisher**: Oh yeah? Well you have cooties and I'm telling Mom
