I previously talked about [reordering my Google reader](/managing-feeds/) in order to make my life less overwhelming.  A little over a month has gone by and I thought I'd post an update about how it's worked.

Things have been a tremendous success.  By simply re-categorizing my feeds into Low Volume, High Value and Low Value I have make my life so much more pleasant.  Here's how it works on a daily basis.

Low Volume: These are feeds that have less then 1 or 2 posts per day in them.  Examples are [Penelope Trunk's Blog](http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/), [Adventures in Capitalism](http://chrisyeh.blogspot.com/) and [Modite](http://modite.com/blog/).  These are feeds that because they are low volume, how much value they produce for me is of little consequence.

High Value: These are feeds that have more then 1 or 2 posts a day but that I want to make sure to pay attention to.  The only 4 feeds I have in this folder are [TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/), [Mashable](http://mashable.com/), [Silicon Alley Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/) and [Brazen Careerist's Featured Posts](http://www.brazencareerist.com/category/features).

Low Value: These are fun feeds that are interesting, sometimes I get value from them, but honestly if I don't get to them it's not the end of the world.  Examples are [AfterEllen.com](http://afterellen.com/), [JDub Records](http://blog.jdubrecords.org/) and [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/).  If I'm busy, I don't bother with these and if they start piling up I just mark them all as read and get on with my life.

I also have a folder for my Google Alerts which I might glance at once in a while and a humor folder where I subscribe to a couple comic strips.

I've found that by organizing feeds on by volume and value I don't feel overwhelmed that I'm missing something important anymore.  With Google Reader on my iPhone I check my feeds whenever I have a little downtime and now I know exactly what I should be checking.
