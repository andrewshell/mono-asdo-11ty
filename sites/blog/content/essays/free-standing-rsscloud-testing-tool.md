I deployed the new rssCloud v2 to a temporary port and I'd like to have a way to poke at it and make sure it's doing what it should be doing. Today I plan on building a simple tool that will allow me to zip through the various combinations of pleaseNotify and ping and check that it works correctly. This is also important to make sure logging is still working correctly.

One of my next projects after v2 is live is to revamp the view log page. Although the way it is currently is better than nothing, it isn't the best interface for debugging aggregators and publishing tools.
