I'm pretty new to the idea of the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and [Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)) in general. I recently signed up for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) to participate in the [Podcast Index Community](https://podcastindex.social/about). 

Mastodon is built on top of a protocol [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/), which seems pretty straightforward.

I recently hopped on a Zoom call with [Ward Cunningham](https://twitter.com/WardCunningham), who has a group of people building [Federated Wiki](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Federated_Wiki), but I haven't dug in enough to find out what's running under the hood. It would be cool if it were ActivityPub. I'm looking forward to learning more because Wiki has always had a place in my heart.

There are also [Federated Blogs](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Federated_Blog).

I've been following my intuition lately. I come across something interesting and follow the thread, leading me back to where I need to be.
