This has been interesting. I'm used to just writing in markdown files, but I'm finding having the nested lines useful. I guess this is why it's called an "Idea Processor". It can however make the text harder to read. For instance my last note about "Custom templates in pagePark" just looks like an impenetrable wall of text. I'm not sure what the solution would be though.
