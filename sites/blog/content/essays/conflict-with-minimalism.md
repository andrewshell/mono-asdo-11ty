I've been trying to be more minimalist lately. I deleted the vast majority of blogs I follow in my RSS feed (I only follow 5 now). One of the blogs I still follow is Far Beyond the Stars by Everett Bogue. Everett is a guy who lives his life with a ridiculously small number of possessions (less than 100). I really resonate with his message but I find that I also conflict with it.

When I moved to CA (and then back again) moving all my stuff was a major expense and hassle. I'm currently living in a condo that's a little over 1000 sq ft and I don't know how my girlfriend could move in with me because there wouldn't be enough room for both of our stuff. Just our clothes alone would be a problem. I have in my bedroom one closet and two tall dressers filled with clothes. I have three drawers filled with t-shirts. This is clearly ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason why two people couldn't live comfortably in my condo. Especially if we're a couple sharing a bedroom.

I've started getting rid of things. I took a bunch of books to [Frugal Muse](http://www.frugalmuse.com/) but they didn't take many of them. I'll probably offer up some of my computer books at my next [PHP Meetup](http://www.madisonphp.com). Some of the stuff I feel like I'd have a hard time getting rid of are my DVDs and CDs. I'm not sure why the idea of getting rid of them bothers me so much. There are other things that I wouldn't want to get rid of like my pinball machine. Ideally, I'd have more pinball machines but I'm not sure why I have this desire to accumulate things.

I would have a lot more freedom without this weird desire to accumulate stuff. I'd be content living in my condo (which is paid off) instead of looking to buy a house and taking on a mortgage. I'd also have more money because I wouldn't be spending it on stuff I don't need. I live within my means, but I have almost no savings. There is no reason I shouldn't be sitting on piles of money because I make a good salary and I don't have a ton of fixed monthly expenses. I'd like to start a business of my own, but I can't right now because of my lack of savings and my dependence on my salary.

Clearly, I need to keep taking steps towards reducing what I spend and what I have. I'd like to have my girlfriend move in when her lease is up in 6 months so ideally, I'll need to get rid of half of what I have in my currently full condo. This is something I can do and I feel like I'll be a much better person for it on the flip side.
