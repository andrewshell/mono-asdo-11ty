> "You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction." â€” Jim Rohn

Jim Rohn was one of the original personal development teachers. He mentored Tony Robbins when Tony was 17 and was a lifelong friend. 

His style was accessible, and his conversational delivery made his common-sense advice incredibly quotable.

This quote has been on my mind lately. After a rocky 2020, I started getting back on my feet in 2021, and over the last three months, I'm on a new path that I wouldn't have anticipated earlier this year.

Two of the biggest changes are my weight loss journey and buying a house. Things can change overnight. You go to bed thinking one thing, you're on one path, and in the morning, you have an idea, you make a decision, and you're suddenly on a new path.

I'm down about 25 lbs with a target of losing 120. It's challenging to make decisions every day that keep me on my path. For example, I'd love to eat an entire pizza right now, but I know it's more important to get thin and healthy.

I know that once I get to my target weight and transition to maintenance, I'll have more flexibility with what I can eat. For example, I probably won't eat an entire pizza, but I should certainly be able to eat a slice or two occasionally.

I keep an eye on my destination, and every day I make sure I'm facing the correct direction. I could certainly take a detour, but right now, it's more important to get to my destination as quickly as possible.
