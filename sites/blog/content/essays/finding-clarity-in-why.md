The number one thing that sabotages me regularly is a lack of clarity.

Clarity is a sneaky thing, and it plays a part in so many aspects of your life. Clarity is a lack of confusion, and it leads to confidence.

So many days, I struggle because I'm not clear about what I should do, what I want to do, and how I'm going to do it. I wonder why I should bother doing something or why I should continue doing things.

If I encounter resistance, I usually decide that it isn't worth the effort. I guess that's the curse of being "the smart kid" in school. You don't learn to try hard, to persevere through difficulty.

In the last couple of days, I've had doubts over finishing my 30 days of writing. Initially, ideas came to me quickly, and it wasn't much effort to spit out 250-300 words on a topic. However, the last week has been more challenging.

I'm a bit surprised that I've lasted this long. I don't have an excellent track record of finishing projects. I get excited about something, go at it for a few weeks, lose interest and go off after something else.

With Ship 30 for 30, it's different. I want to get through the 30 days without interruption. I want to prove to myself that I have the power to finish something. Maybe, if I can get myself to ship for 30 days, I will have a chance to stick to a healthy diet and lose weight.

It seems silly that something so small can represent something so big. But perhaps, finding clarity to my "Why?" will be enough to push me over the finish line.
