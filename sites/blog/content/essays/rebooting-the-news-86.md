Today's episode of [Rebooting The News](https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/rebooting-the-news-86/) Jay was out of town so Dave had on Adam Curry and yours truly!  I wish I could say I was invited to be a guest, but Dave was just taking calls and picked me.  On the show I talk about my work trying to use WordPress as a microblog platform.  It's an interesting show, but if you want to skip directly to my part jump to 31:45.

If you're interested in listening you can hear the [clip](/uploads/2011/03/reboot11mar14-asclip.mp3) or the [entire episode](http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/reboot11mar14.mp3).
