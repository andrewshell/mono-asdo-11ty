Interesting timing. I've been talking to Dave lately about nodeEditor and how things worked in Frontier. Then I opened Instapaper today and was scanning through pages I had bookmarked to read later and came across a <a href="http://this.how/frontier/howFrontierGotStarted.opml">How Frontier got started</a> which had an attached podcast that was super interesting.

I knew a little bit of this, but I had no idea how deeply integrated everything is in Frontier. Very cool.

It's also interesting because when I bookmarked this I had no idea what <a href="http://this.how/">this.how</a> was and now I run my own version of it.
