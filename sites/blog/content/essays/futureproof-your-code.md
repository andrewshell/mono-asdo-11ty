Frameworks, libraries, and components are great. They can greatly simplify the process of writing applications. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. However what happens when the landscape changes? Your favorite library is no longer supported. The framework you've built your application on is no longer receiving updates. How you react to this news greatly depends on how you've built your application.

In this talk, Andrew Shell will cover how to architect your applications to allow you to leverage all the power from these tools without exposing your application to unnecessary risk. He'll also demo how you can use [Radar](http://radarphp.com/), a library that can make it easier to build your application in a future-proof way.
