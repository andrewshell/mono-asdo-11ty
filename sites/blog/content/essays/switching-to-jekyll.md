After running my blog for many years on WordPress I've recently decided to migrate over to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) running on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

The design is using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) with some special Google Fonts [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Gentium Book Basic](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Book+Basic). I think it looks really nice and it's responsive.

It took a lot of tweaking, but the site should match the same URLs as the old WordPress site, so hopefully there won't be many broken links.  The biggest part of the site that's missing is the monthly archives that used to be in the sidebar.  Unfortunatly that's only available in Jekyll as a plugin and GitHub Pages doesn't support plugins.  So for the time being there is a single [archive page](/archive/) that shows all of my posts.
