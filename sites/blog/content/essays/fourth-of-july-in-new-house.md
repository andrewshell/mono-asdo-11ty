It's been a crazy year since the last 4th of July.  Andrea and I got married in October.  Then we went on our honeymoon to Disney World and of January.  On our way home I got pneumonia (the first time) and that started a chain of events that led to having heart surgery.  Then 10 days after having heart surgery Andrea and I closed on our house.

Even though we have a lot of unpacking to do I hope that things will settle down for a bit.  As part of my recovery I've reduced my responsibilities to a minimum.  I've stopped organizing the PHP Meetup, doing freelance work, planning Barcamp, volunteering at the Humane Society and more.  I had to set my priorities which at this point are my health, family and job.  Everything else has to be lower priority.  If I'm tired I need to rest and I can't be stressed out all the time.

This is a big step for me since I've always had a thousand things on my plate.  It's hard for me to learn to say no.
