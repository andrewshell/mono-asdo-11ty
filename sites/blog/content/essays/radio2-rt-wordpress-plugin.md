Maps the Radio2 style RT standard onto the Press This URL. (see [A standard for RT'ing?](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/03/aStandardForRting.html))

This plugin checks for any of three query string params (link, title, description). If they are present it redirects the page to the /wp-admin/press-this.php page with the params u, t, s and v set appropriately.

The purpose is so static rivers like [http://tech.newsriver.org/](http://tech.newsriver.org/) will be able to send a RT request to your blog.

UPDATE: I haven't abandoned the plugin yet, but I'm thinking perhaps I should.  It seems that Dave has moved on from promoting the standard and is not supporting it in [Fargo](http://fargo.io/docs/blogging/settingUpANoteblog.html) or in any of [his currently published rivers](http://scripting.com/river/).
