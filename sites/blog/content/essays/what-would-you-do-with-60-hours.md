I'm not a huge fan of new years resolutions. I think most people throw out some big vague goal like "lose weight" or "start my own business" then forget about it by the end of January.

I was just thinking of a different approach to new years resolutions. What could you accomplish if you spent 60 hours working on your goal in 2011? Well, guess what? That breaks down to approximately 10 minutes a day.

If you just decide to spend 10 minutes every day working toward your goal you will spend about 5 hours a month or 60 hours a year.

How about spend 10 minutes a day meditating or reading? Or spend 10 minutes every morning doing some jumping jacks to boost your metabolism? Maybe you should pick a few goals and dedicate 10 minutes a day on each one?

What will you spend 10 minutes a day on in 2011?
