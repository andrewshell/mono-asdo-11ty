I came home for lunch today and I feel like crap. I feel stressed and tired most of the time.

I shouldn't though. Since the end of December I've been doing yoga 2-3 times a week. Even though I have an 8-month old daughter I actually sleep pretty well. My job does stress me out pretty regularly, but it's way better than it was back in August. I have two great developers on my team now that I'm able to have work on things so I don't have to.

However I don't eat particularly well. My wife and I are trying to improve, but it's difficult. I don't typically plan my meals in advance which puts me in situations where I'm hungry and I need to find something to eat. That usually means I end up going out to eat or eating something quick at home that may not be ideal for being healthy.

So today I had an idea. Before I eat something, I need to ask myself a simple question.

Will this make me feel better tomorrow?

This doesn't have to only apply to food. Just something in general I should be more aware of. I think too much of my daily habits are less than ideal, and happen because I'm trying to solve a short term problem. How do I make myself feel better now? What can I eat now?

Yes, I do need to start planning my food out more, but hopefully this minor change will help me make better decisions in the short term.
