Here are three of my favorite books about productivity and goal setting.

## Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy

The book's tagline is "21 great ways to stop procrastination and get more done in less time". For example, if it's your job to eat a frog every day, you'd best do it first thing in the morning because everything will be easier after that. Of course, he's not suggesting you eat literal frogs but rather tackle your most important task, the one you'd rather put off first thing in the morning. It's a quick read with great actionable advice and no fluff.

## How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams

Part autobiography, part advice, this book is one of the most valuable books I've read in recent memory. One of the key ideas in this book is the concept of skill stacking. Scott explains that instead of working super hard to become one of the top performers in your field, you're better off becoming pretty good at several complementary skills and creating your unique domain. For example, he said he carved out a niche that he could dominate by combining his mediocre humor, writing, drawing, and years of corporate business experience.

## Start Finishing by Charlie Gilkey

This book outlines a process for how to prioritize and plan your projects so you complete them. Charlie moves you along the process giving you frameworks with acronyms to help you think about your projects differently. For instance, he talks about IABCD (Intention, Awareness, Boundaries, Courage, and Discipline) as things required to prevent life from getting in the way of your goals.
