I'm probably going to be moving my site soon to be powered by [Dave Winer's Trex](http://smallpicture.com/trexDocs.html) but that means that my RSS feed URL will change.  Right now it's either https://blog.andrewshell.org/feed/ or https://blog.andrewshell.org/feed/index.xml but as of right now the new location is [https://blog.andrewshell.org/rss.xml](https://blog.andrewshell.org/rss.xml).

This post will be the last one you'll get if you're subscribed to one of the old feeds.  If you would like to continue to hear from me please switch the URL in your feed reader or [sign up for my e-mail newsletter](http://eepurl.com/K3PV).
