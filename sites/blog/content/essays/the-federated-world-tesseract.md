The more I look at [FedWiki](http://fedwiki.org/view/welcome-visitors/view/federated-wiki), the more overlap I see with the work [Dave](http://scripting.com/) has been doing with outliners and publishing. Especially with [Trex](http://docs.fargo.io/contentManagement/trex/) and the [World Outline](http://howto.worldoutline.org/). 

> The World Outline is like the World Wide Web, except instead of a web of linked pages, it's an array of outlines that include other outlines. The outlines can live anywhere on the Internet. They are accessed over HTTP.

I released an experiment [opml.wiki](http://opml.wiki/) that consumes FedWiki JSON files and turns them into an OPML file. Seeing this hybrid gives me all sorts of ideas. I see these two platforms as three-dimensional representations of a [four-dimensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) object.

Add in a good helping of [the semantic web utopia](https://doriantaylor.com/the-symbol-management-problem), stir, and let it simmer.
