The best way to grow is to implement systems that incorporate feedback loops.

On Saturday, I talked about validating your lead metrics. This is one example of a powerful concept in personal development, Feedback loops.

If you want to grow consistently, you need to implement feedback loops. A feedback loop is evidence that what you are doing is working.

With lead metrics, you want feedback that what you are doing is leading to your lag metrics.

When reading a book, taking notes written in your own words is a feedback loop to comprehend what you're reading. If you only quote the text or save highlights to Readwise, you miss out on feedback.

When studying, you create flashcards to test your knowledge. This is a feedback loop that you remember what you've learned. You don't want the exam in class to be the first feedback that you don't understand the subject.

Teaching is another feedback loop. It's giving you feedback on whether or not you understand a topic enough to communicate it clearly to another person. That person will ask questions, and your ability to answer those questions is feedback on how thoroughly you understand the topic.

When you're starting a business, you break it down into smaller feedback loops. Can you reach your target market? Do they have the problem you think they do? Does your solution solve their problem enough for them to pay you money?

Don't waste your time working on the wrong thing. Instead, identify your feedback loops so you can get validation as soon as possible that you're doing the right thing.
