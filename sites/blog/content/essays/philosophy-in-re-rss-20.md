This morning I read <a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/stories/storyReader$1744">Philosophy in re RSS 2.0</a>

My favorite quote was from Sean Gallagher "I mean, here we are, a country on the edge of being dragged into a war by some whack-job Texan with the IQ of a Post-It Note (TM), and people are badgering each other over RDF?"

I know enough about RSS history and other standards wars that it's not surprising, however I don't understand what's going on in peoples heads. If people are already using something, don't break them! It seems very obvious and simple.

It's like Apple dropping 32-bit support from Catalina. Why? Apple is sitting on a mountain of cash. They can't hire a few developers to make sure 32-bit apps keep running?
