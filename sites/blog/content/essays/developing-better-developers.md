Just read <a href="http://this.how/phoenix/index.opml">Developing better developers</a> it sounds like a great idea. I think a similar idea could also be bootstrapped outside of universities. Something that combines an open-source project with a meetup group. Senior devs can teach and work with the junior devs for the benefit of the project.

I was involved with starting something like this with the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pivot-libre/dashboard">Pivot Libre</a> project. A friend who was very into politics and had been an alderman in the past had an idea to create an open-source project for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs">ranked pair elections</a>. It was good. We had a bunch of people, some technical, many not. We all got together and even though I left the project because I didn't have the time to commit, it's still going. It sounds like it's even been used in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxqrV9O7UivxjeU9vuDPCiByyB0rPA1ByO2iPeaf4ts/edit?usp=sharing">few smaller elections</a>.
