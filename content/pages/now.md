## House Projects

For most of the year I was busy helping my mom move to Madison. She's now my next door neighbor. Because of this, I never got around to finishing the floors in my house and have lived with subfloors, staples, and tack strips in half of my house. I had hoped to wrap things up in time for Thanksgiving, but I decided not to stress myself out and I'll make the turkey and take it to my moms house.

## Releasing old Goals

There have been goals of mine that I held on to my entire life. I've decided that it's time to [release them](https://sive.rs/pets). I'm not sure what will be next, but I don't want to get stuck "shoulding all over myself"
